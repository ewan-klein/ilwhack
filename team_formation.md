# Team Formation

## Overview talk 
#### 14:00-14:10

*We need to start promptly. Or even a bit before 14:00?*

We'll do a 10 minute introduction to what kinds of teams could be formed and what kinds of things they could do. 


*Ewan to do intro, Arno on design, James on value and sustainability. NB Look at winning criteria again to make sure we're happy with them.*



## Phase 1 
#### 14:10-14:20

*We could skip this or merge it with Phase 2. But it seems quite nice as a warm up and for people to get a sense of who else is around.*

Get to know people! In this phase, you are going to introduce yourself to at least four other people.  Of course, these should be people that you don't already know. Each of you spend about a minute to answer the following questions:

1. What's your name?
* What degree are you enrolled on?
* What are your particular skills and experience?
* What kind of project do you want to work on this week?
* What do you hope to get out of this week?


## Phase 2 
#### 14:20-14:50

We'll demarcate areas of the room for particular themes. 

*We need to*

* *review themes*
* *get big pieces of paper and bluetack to show which part of room is which*

Move to the location of the theme which most appeals to you. In Phase 1 you should have said a bit about what kind of project you want to work on. Introduce yourself to five people that you haven't already met, and swap project ideas. You might want to have a piece of paper to jot down your ideas as they evolve. Don't worry if you have several project ideas &mdash; just keep track of them for the time being.

## Phase 3 
#### 14:50-15:00

There are three white boards at the front of the room. Go up to one of these and write down:

1. your name
2. your project ideas

Then go and take a break.


## Break 
#### 15:00-15:15
Bio-break

*Is it too late to get tea laid on?*

*We'll have to triage the ideas very quickly*


## Phase 4 

#### 15:15-16:15

We'll ask about 20 or so people to come up to the front of the room and  pitch **one** project idea to the whole room. If you are pitching, you will get one minute to pitch your idea. So if you have more than one, you'll have to decide your favourite; this should also be a project that you really want to do! Each of the ideas pitched in this way will form the nucleus for a team.

We'll now ask everyone who didn't pitch to join one of the idea-pitchers. Remember that there are at most **six** people in each team, so there may need to be some horse-trading and shuffling about. It might also be expedient to 'fork' a very popular project idea into variants.

Choose a team manager. The main duties of the manager are:

1. Get the contact details (name, mobile number, email address, ...) of everyone in the team.
2. Ensure that there is an initial meeting of the team to decide roles; establish ground rules for turning up; discuss and help decide what the main priorities of the project are; make an initial project plan.
3. Ensure that the team's initial details are registered according to the [procedure described on the Smart Data Hack website](http://smartdatahack.org/#teams) by 13:00 on Tuesday 17th Feb and finalised by 12:00 Friday 20th Feb.
4. Review the project plan and priorities as the week progresses and try to keep everyone on track.

The manager does not have to be the idea-pitcher and does not have to be the technical lead for the project.

# Explanatory Notes

Data comes from the City of Edinburgh Council's 2013 Air Quality Progress
Report, available at
<http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/file/11564/laqm_progress_report_2013>.

## Annotations

The `.xlsx` file contains a number of annotations, as follows:



* In yellow, newly added diffusion tubes from 2012
* In bold, excedence of the NO2 annual mean objective of 40μg/m3 and in
bold, results of 40μg/m3 shown
* Underlined, annual mean greater than 60μg/m3, indicating a potential
exceedence of the NO2 hourly mean objective

## Alphabetic notes

**[a]**: All data is representative of relevant exposure, except at background
sites India Street (ID34), Hillview Terrace (ID41) and Midmar Drive
(ID42), which are not distance corrected.

**[b]**: Where full calendar year data capture is less than 75%, the means have
been estimated using DEFRA Technical Guidance on Local Air Quality
Management, further explanations of which can be found in Box 3.2 of that
Guidance
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69334/pb13081-tech-guidance-laqm-tg-09-090218.pdf>

**[c]**: Princes Street (ID47) data in brackets represents pavement exposure 2.5m
from the kerb. Data without brackets represents concentrations at the facade.

## Terminology

**AQMA**: AQMA means Air Quality Management Area, i.e. designated zones where the
Council has officially declared that air pollution levels are above legal
limits.

**Relevant Exposure**: The Environment Act makes it clear that likely
exceedences of the air quality objectives should be assessed in relation
to “the quality of the air at locations which are situated outside of
buildings or other other natural or man-made structures, above or below
ground, and where members of the public are regularly present”. So Column
G confirms whether the diffusion tube's location is representative of
relevant exposure.

**Bias Adjustment Factor**: The City of Edinburgh Council has corrected the
data readings using a correction factor which is explained in Appendix A
of its Update and Progress Report.
